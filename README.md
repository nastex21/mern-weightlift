Still a Work in Progress

Demo: https://nameless-headland-15212.herokuapp.com/api/signup

It started out as an app to track weightlifting but I eventually expanded it to included other types of exercise groups such as cardiovascular, bodyweight training and exercise classes and videos. 

This app allows you to register with your own unique username and password and add your exercise statistics for a particular exercise group.

Basic functionality works but there still some needs such as:

-Still need to clean the UI and web page. Looks a bit janky.

-Add a landing page

-Optimize the mobile side 

Released 1.01
- Fixed registration problem

Future incoming fixes:
- Make the landing page look better
- Needs better styling

Released 1.00
- App works but had some problems with the registration.
